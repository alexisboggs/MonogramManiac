# MonogramManiacs

Day 1 (February 20, 2019)
Our thought process began with the decision to create a website in the form of a boutique. The website is going to contain monogrammed t-shirts, and cups! Our boutique is going to be called Sew Many Monograms. 

Day 2 (February 21, 2019)
Today we made our wireframe for our website. We created the Nav bar and all of the features the Nav-bar would contain. Our website is going to have a home page, a “best sellers” page, a “what’s new” page, a “weekly deal” page, a “Sale” page, and also a “Contact” page. While creating our wireframes we drew out everything we wanted to be on our website. 

Day 3 (February 25, 2019)
Today we had some difficulty getting started in codepen. We could not figure out how to start our project. After about 20 minutes we finally figured it out, and got started on our project. We started on our home page. 

Day 4 (February 26, 2019)
Today we hope to work more on our home page. We are working on adding a navigation bar. We added the navigation bar and it looks great!

Day 6 (February 28, 2019)

Day 17 (March 19, 2019))
Today we changed our deal of the week page to say “weekly deal” that way it would be shorter and look alot cleaner on our navbar we also tried to make our comments box bigger on our contact page but couldn’t figure out how to make the boxes bigger, we just kept making them longer instead of making them bigger in width.
